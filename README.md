# AboutMe
Hello! My name is Austin Gage and I'm a Software Engineer residing in Upstate New York.
I graduated from Siena College in May of 2020 with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a Major GPA of 3.6, since then I've been loving my career as a software developer.
My experience in Software Development is mainly in Object Oriented Programming with my most proficient languages being PHP, JavaScript, and Java. However I have experiencing coding in HTML, CSS, Python, Typescript, and frameworks like Angular, Vue, and Express.
I have experience working in Databases aswell such as Oracle DB and NoSQL databases.
I am currently trying to expand my knowledge and learn as many new things as possible, recently I gained my first AWS certification passing the CLF C02 Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam, and now I am working on improving my skills with popular Web Development frameworks like Angular.
I plan on uploading some projects to improve my github repository and showcase what I am capable of as a developer. When some projects are far enough along I may put them up on AWS so they would be a functioning website, however there is more work to be done on my end before that can happen.
