# AboutMe
Hello! My name is Austin Gage and I'm a Computer Science major currently searching for a career in Software Development.
I graduated from Siena College in three years with my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science with a Major GPA of 3.6.
My experience in Software Development is mainly in Object Oriented Programming with my most proficient languages being Java and Python. However I have experiencing coding in HTML,CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and C#.
I have experience worknig in Databases aswell such as Oracle DB and NoSQL databases.
I am currently trying to expand my knowledge and learn as many new things as possible, I've made it a goal for myself to complete atleast a single interview coding style question a day and upload it here.
Also planning to start working on a bigger project that will also be uploaded here, the specifics of this will be a secret for now ;).
